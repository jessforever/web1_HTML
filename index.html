<h2>Simply Bake!</h2>
<p><strong><a href ="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ta5hqA9YbJY&t=183s" target="_blank" title="겉바속촉 brownie">Baking box</a></strong> is a kit which is composed of delicious recipies and <u>lots of ingredients</u> which will make you convenient to cook what you want</p>
<p>To bake things we need an oven, lots of ingredients that we won't use in daily life, tools that is quiet expensive to buy but don't use often. <br>These are the things that makes baking hard.
So we decided to provide tools and ingredietns that are needed to bake somthing only once. <br>You don't need to worry about the space to put all the baking stuff and refrigerator to keep the ingredients fresh.
